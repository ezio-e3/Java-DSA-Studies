## Arrays?
Arrays are data structures that store data of the same type in **contiguous** memory locations, meaning the memory addresses
are next to each other. Arrays have a fixed defined size and are good for fast data retrieval but has a limitation 
when it comes to deleting data as there are no inbuilt delete methods (JAVA)
