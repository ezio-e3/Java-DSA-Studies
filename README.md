## Arrays?
Arrays are data structures with a fixed defined size that store data in **contiguous** memory locations, meaning memory 
addresses are right next to each other. This data structure is good for quick data retrieval but is limited in deleting 
data as there is no inbuilt delete method on arrays in **JAVA**, so you would need to write a custom method to delete 
elements in your array.
